            Hi, my name is Mark. I am an overly enthusiastic, and exceptionally passionate Computer Science Major living
            the Front Range area of Colorado. Naturally, living in such a beautiful mountain landscape, I love all
            things outdoors. Except I don’t. The view is nice, but I prefer a heated pool to a frigid mountain lake,
            and a nice evening on the couch with bad movies over a campfire in the woods. Really, who wants to have to
            set up a whole tent and campsite just to pack it all up in the next 48 hours? I like fishing though.
            Sometimes I even catch things.

            What I do really enjoy is everything nerdy. Sci-Fi/Fantasy stuff, comic books, video games, arcades, anime,
            anything mentioned in “Weird Al’s White and Nerdy”.  Just think of anything you can associate with the word
            nerd, or geek, or the phrase “3 Time Magic the Gathering: Game Day Champion”. Got a good picture in your
            head yet? Nice! Let me add a few things to really bring it into focus. I use to play Team Fortress 2
            semi-professionally (captain of Duck Soup Gaming). I currently play way too much DOTA 2.

            I have a collection of good Kung Fu movies. I have a collection of bad Kung Fu movies. I’ve watched nearly
            every episode of anything Gordon Ramsey has ever been in, and yet all I know how to cook is steak and
            chicken wings. I’m the kind of person that always does the math. The official strategy guide can say it’s
            more DPS, but I want to know for sure. We all make mistakes. One time I spent an entire day wondering why
            I couldn’t make a condition false in my code. That’s how I learned to look for semi-colons after conditions.

            Currently I work for the Loveland Public Library in Adult Services. I love being able to connect people to
            information. I love working with our statistics and data. Every month I host an online book club for
            Sci-Fi/Fantasy. I also help with our homebound program where we deliver resources to patrons who are
            disabled or otherwise can’t visit the library. I strongly believe that every person has a right to
            information and knowledge. Fahrenheit 451 describes one of my worst fears (read it if you haven’t).
            Coming from a computer science background, I find new ways to innovate all kinds of things workplaces
            would never think to do. I wish to keep fostering community growth and enabling people to find the
            information they seek.
